    "If you've struggled with finding molecular normal modes, this post is for you. Instead of using the character table and calculating symmetry operations by hand, I will introduce a very general method for finding the normal modes that is all done algorithmically. \n",
    "\n",
    "This mode shows how to find the normal modes given the symmetry operations of a molecule or cluster. The key is to find a linear transformation from the Cartesian basis to a symmetry adapted basis that block-diagonalizes the symmetry representation. The three normal modes of an equilateral triangle are shown here, and this post explores how to calculate and plot these modes.\n",

    "We begin by considering all of the available degrees of freedom (dofs) of our molecule. In 2D, each atom can move in two directions ($x$ or $y$) so there a total of $2\\times N$ dofs where $N$ is the number of atoms in the molecule. \n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of degrees of freedom of a 3D molecule of $N$ atoms is $3N$ since each atom can displace in the $x$, $y$, or $z$ direction. This means that we can define a $3N$ dimensional vector-space that spans all of these degrees of freedom. A coordinate in this space is expressed as a $3N$ dimensional vector $\\mathbf{x}$. The basis that one first considers in this space is the simple Cartesian basis. However, a simpler basis is achievable which separates this space into irreducible subspaces. \n",
