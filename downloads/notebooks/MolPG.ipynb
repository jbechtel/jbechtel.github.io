In words, this relation means that a spatial isometry (by which we mean a rotation or reflection of space) applied to the molecule is equivalent to a permutation of the atoms. \n",

    "\n",
    "2). In the special case when $\\mathbf{R}$ contains only two atoms which are linearly indepedent, it is invertible. This gives us a means to generate possible spatial isometries, $\\mathbf{S}$, via $\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{R}_{\\text{new}} \\mathbf{R}^{-1}_{\\text{orig}}$, where $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{orig}}$ and $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{new}}$ are two different $2\\times2$ matrices formed from two columns of $\\mathbf{R}$.\n",

    "1). First enumerate all pairs of atoms contained in $\\mathbf{R}$ giving $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{orig}}$ and $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{new}}$. If the columns of $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{orig}}$ are linearly dependent, it is possible that either a 180 degree rotation, or a reflection about the line connecting the two atoms is a symmetry operation of the molecule. \n",
    "\n",
    "2). If the columns are not collinear, then a possible symmetry operation is $\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{R}_{\\text{new}} \\mathbf{R}^{-1}_{\\text{orig}}$. However, to be a valid operation it must be orthogonal (unitary) and satisfy $\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{S}^{\\top}=1$. If $\\mathbf{S}$ satisfies these conditions then it is added to a list of possible point group operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3). Lastly, we test the operations $\\mathbf{S}$ on the whole molecule by verifying that there exist an $\\mathbf{M}$ for which $ \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{M}$. If this works we add $\\mathbf{S}$ to the list of symmetry  operations as long as it isn't already in the list."
