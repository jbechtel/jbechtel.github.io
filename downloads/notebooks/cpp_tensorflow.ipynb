    "TensorFlow developed by Google, is an open source implementation of computational graphs which make it perfect for implementing any type of neural network architecture you'd want. The python API and the related tutorials make it easy to rapidly prototype a model. However, I recently found myself in need of the C++ API, so I could insert a model into a project I've been working on in c++. \n",
